# ASSESSMENT 1: INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT
## Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer:
  A function in JavaScript is used to tell the computer what to do with values, arrays, etc. It can process numbers, strings, booleans, etc. in order to return the desired information to the end user.

  Researched answer:
  A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.


2. List 5 examples of JavaScript array methods.

  Your answer:
  1. map - creates new array of same size with some sort of function applied to each index
  2. filter - tests old array with a function and creates new array (typically smaller) containing values that were true to the function
  3. sort - sorts array in a requested order
  4. push - takes specific array index and adds it to new array
  5. join - combines array into a string

  Researched answer:
  1. concat - merges two or more arrays and returns a new array
  2. forEach - calls a function once for each element of an array
  3. includes - determines if an array includes a certain element
  4. pop - removes the last element of an array and returns that element
  5. reverse - reverses the order of elements in an array


3. Explain the difference between console.log() and return.

  Your answer:
  console.log will print out the result into the command window. return will return the value of something to a function after it runs through that function.

  Researched answer:
  console.log writes a message to the console.
  return stops the execution of a function and returns a value from that function.


4. In regards to functions, what is an argument? What is the difference between an argument and a variable?

  Your answer:
  An argument is not defined like a variable. Arguments are place holders that can take any value or variable to be plugged into a function.

  Researched answer:
  An argument is the real value passed to and received by the function.


5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the rolls of each person?

  Your answer:
  There should be a driver and a navigator. The driver does the typing and tries to work through problems. The navigator will assist with suggestions or advice if the driver is stuck. The navigator may take over but it should not be abused.

  Researched answer:
  Driver:
  - writes
  - listen to navigator's instructions
  - ask questions and make suggestions
  - clean up code
  - ignore larger issues, focus on task at hand
  - know when to give up keyboard

  Navigator:
  - communicates what code to writes with reasons why
  - check for syntax/type errors
  - make sure driver sticks to small task at hand
  - know when to take keyboard


6. Give a brief description of JavaScript as if you were explaining it to someone who doesn't know anything about programming.

  Your answer:
  JavaScript is a popular programming language that might be used on many websites. Anytime you do things like playing videos on YouTube or searching through Google, there's a good chance that JavaScript is being used to send your information to the web server so they can process your request and return your request as some sort of action.


7. What is one thing we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer:
  I find the most helpful things in class are the examples. I learn best by solving challenging problems repeatedly by using a guide or answer sheet for assistance when I'm stuck. The very few times this has happened in class has been very helpful in giving me an understanding of the syntax, which seems to be where I'm struggling most.
